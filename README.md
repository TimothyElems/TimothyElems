I'm a Full-Stack Developer and content creator transferring knowledge to whoever seeks to receive it. All coding projects are built from the ground up, (unless otherwise stated) from planning, designing, and implementing solutions to real-world problems. 

*Disclaimer: I only post personal projects. I'll do well to ensure that these personal projects reflect my professional skills*
