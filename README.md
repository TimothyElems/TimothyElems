``` Digital Craftsman (Developer/Creator/Musician)```

I'm a Full-Stack Developer and content creator transferring knowledge to whoever seeks to receive it. All coding projects are built from the ground up, (unless otherwise stated) from planning, designing, to implementing solutions to real-world problems. All video content is made, using the same template. I publish the video content on my YouTube channel "[Bytes Of Py](https://www.youtube.com/@BytesOfPy/featured)" to 0 subscribers.
